# arduino_midi_pins
Super simple Arduino program that turns button presses into note on and off MIDI events.

Load it up onto an Arduino Due and hook up some buttons, one pin of each connected to a GPIO, the other connected to ground. Then plug it in. It'll act as a USB MIDI device that sends note on and off commands when each button is pressed.
